"### Instruction:\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this standard is to establish the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) requirements for\nany NASA system or component, flight or ground, where fracture control is a requirement.  This\nstandard defines the primary requirements for NDE in support of NASA-STD-5019, Fracture\nControl Requirements for Spaceflight Hardware.  NDE applied in-process for purposes of process\ncontrol is not addressed in this document.\nIt is the policy of NASA to produce aerospace flight systems with a high degree of reliability and\nsafety.  This is accomplished through good design, manufacturing, test, and operational practices\nincluding the judicious choice of materials, detailed analysis, appropriate factors of safety, rigorous\ntesting and control of hardware, and reliable inspection.  NASA fracture control requirements\nstipulate that all aerospace flight systems be subjected to fracture control procedures to preclude\ncatastrophic failure.  Those procedures frequently rely on NDE to ensure that significant crack-like\nflaws are not present in critical areas.\na.  NDE processes shall meet the requirements in this standard to screen hardware reliably\nfor the presence of crack-like flaws.\nb.  Nothing in this document shall be construed as requiring duplication of effort dictated by\nother contract provisions.\nc.  Conversely, provisions stated herein shall not be interpreted to preclude compliance with\nrequirements invoked by other provisions.\n\n### Output:\nSuggesting Changes: Yes\nCurrent Language: ""This standard defines the primary requirements for NDE in support of NASA-STD-5019, Fracture Control Requirements for Spaceflight Hardware.

Special NDE Capability demonstration planning shall be approved by NDE\nengineering.\n4.3.4  NDE Capability Demonstration Specimens\nThe most accepted method of demonstrating Special NDE capability is with fatigue-cracked\nspecimens.  The preparation and control of demonstration specimens and how to administer\ndemonstration tests should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823.  In special cases, other flaws or\ncrack types that are more representative of the application may be used for the demonstration\nwith the approval of the RFCB and Technical Authority.\na.  Special NDE demonstration specimen selection shall be justified and approved based\non the similarity between the test hardware and the demonstration specimen.\nb.  The justification shall be documented in the NDE summary report.\n4.3.5  Point Estimate Method\nThe Point Estimate Method approach assumes that the capability of flaw detection increases with\nthe size of flaws in the neighborhood of the test flaw size.  Since only a small number of flaws are\nrequired by this method, the minimum detectable flaw size may not be a determinant.\nThe above assumption shall be demonstrated or verified by documented evidence before the Point\nEstimate Method can be implemented.\nQualification by this method demonstrates that the procedure and the individual operator are\ncapable of detecting flaws of the test size and larger.  Use of the Point Estimate Method should be\nin accordance with the recommended practice found in Materials Evaluation, Vol. 40, No. 9, pp\n922-932, 1982 (see section 5.1, Reference Documents).\n4.3.6  POD Method\nThis method requires a large range of flaw sizes that span the initial crack size.  The large number\nof flaws required by this method usually allows a minimum detectable flaw size to be determined.\nQualification by this method demonstrates that the procedure, either manual or automated, and\nthe individual operator are capable of detecting the minimum detectable flaw size and larger.

"### Instruction:\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this NASA Technical Standard  is to establish  the nondestructive  evaluation\n(NDE) requirements  for any NASA system or component,  flight  or ground,  where fracture\ncontrol  is a requirement.  This  NASA Technical  Standard defines the primary  requirements  for\nNDE in support  of NASA-STD-5019A,  Fracture Control  Requirements  for Spaceflight\nHardware. NDE applied  in-process  for purposes of process control  and NDE of damage tolerant\ncomposites  are not addressed in  this document.\nIt is the policy  of NASA to produce aerospace flight  systems with a high  degree of reliability  and\nsafety. This  is accomplished  through  good  design,  manufacturing,  test, and operational  practices,\nincluding  the judicious  choice of materials,  detailed  analysis,  appropriate  factors of safety,\nrigorous  testing and control  of hardware, and reliable  inspection.  NASA fracture control\nrequirements  stipulate  that all  human-rated aerospace flight  systems be subjected  to fracture\ncontrol  procedures to preclude  catastrophic failure. Those procedures frequently  rely on NDE to\nensure that the potential  failure  initiation  of relevant  crack-like flaws are not present in critical\nareas.\nPrograms that are not human-rated  may choose to impose  these requirements  on a mission  or\nhardware to bolster  the program or to serve as a stepping-stone  for human-rating.\n\n### Output:\nSuggesting Changes: No\nCurrent Language: N/A\nSuggested Language: N/A\nReason For Change: N/A"

"### Instruction:\nSCOPE\n1.1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this standard is to establish NASA structural strength design and test factors, as\nwell as service life factors to be used for spaceflight hardware development and verification.  It\nis intended to reduce space project costs and schedules by enhancing the commonalty of use of\nhardware designs among NASA flight projects, Centers, and their contractors.  While it is true\nthat structural designs are sometimes governed by criteria other than strength, the criteria in this\ndocument are to be considered as minimum acceptable values unless adequate engineering risk\nassessment is provided which justifies the use of lower values.\n1.2\nApplicability\nThis standard recommends engineering practices for NASA programs and projects.  It may be\ncited in contract, program, and other Agency documents as a technical requirement.\nRequirements are numbered and indicated by the word “shall.”  Explanatory text or guidance is\nindicated in italics beginning in section 4.\n1.2.1  Tailoring of this standard for application to a specific program or project shall be\nformally documented as part of program/project requirements and approved by the assigned\nTechnical Authority.\nDetermining the suitability of this standard and its provisions is the responsibility of\nprogram/project management and the performing organization.

"### Instruction:\nSCOPE\n1.1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Standard is to establish NASA structural design and test factors, as well as\nservice life factors to be used for spaceflight hardware development and verification.  The\nprimary objective of this Standard is to define factors which ensure safe and reliable structural\ndesigns.  The secondary objective is to reduce space project costs and schedules by enhancing\nthe commonality of use of hardware designs among NASA flight projects, Centers, and their\ncontractors.  The criteria in this Standard are to be considered as minimum acceptable values\nunless adequate engineering risk assessment is provided that justifies the use of lower values.\n1.2\nApplicability\nThis Standard defines engineering practices for NASA programs and projects.  It may be cited in\ncontract, program, and other Agency documents as a technical requirement.  Requirements are\nnumbered and indicated by the word “shall.”  Explanatory text or guidance is indicated in italics\nbeginning in section 4.\n1.2.1  Tailoring of this Standard for application to a specific program or project shall be\nformally documented as part of program/project requirements and approved by the responsible\nTechnical Authority.\n1.2.2  NASA programs and projects that do not meet the provisions of this Standard shall be\nassessed by the NASA Program Manager for the associated risk to the success of the planned\nNASA mission and approved by the responsible Technical Authority.\n1.2.3  This Standard shall not supersede applicable laws and regulations unless a specific\nexemption has been obtained by the Office of the NASA Chief Engineer.\nThe criteria in this Standard are applicable to launch vehicle payloads and launch vehicle\nstructures (including propellant tanks and solid rocket motor (SRM) cases).  These criteria apply\nto flight hardware that is utilized for NASA missions.  This Standard presents acceptable\nminimum factors of safety for use in analytical assessment and test verification of structural\nadequacy of the flight hardware.  Designs are generally to be verified by both structural analyses\nand tests.\nCriteria are specified for design and test of flight articles when the actual flight hardware is\ntested (protoflight), and when qualification tests are conducted on a separate (prototype) article.\nIn general, no distinction is made between “human-rated” and “robotic” missions.  Structures of\nhuman-rated flight systems may be subjected to additional verification and/or safety\nrequirements (e.g., fracture control) that are consistent with the established risk levels for\nmission success and flight crew safety.\nAPPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE—DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED\n6 of 25\nNASA-STD-5001B\nSpecifically excluded from this Standard are requirements for design loads determination and\nfracture control.

This Standard also does\nnot cover specific configuration factors, such as fitting factors, buckling knockdown factors, and\nload uncertainty factors.\n1.3\nConstraints and Preconditions\nThe criteria of this Standard were developed in the context of structural and mechanical systems\ndesigns that are amenable to engineering analyses by current state-of-the-art methods and are in\nconformance with standard aerospace industry practices.  More specifically, the designs are\nassumed to use materials having mechanical properties that are well characterized for the\nintended service environments and all design conditions.

This standard recommends preferred engineering practices for NASA\nprograms and projects.  It may be cited in contracts and program documents as a technical\nrequirement or as a reference for guidance.  Determining the suitability of this standard and its\nprovisions is the responsibility of program/project management and the performing organization.\nIndividual provisions of this standard may be tailored (i.e., modified or deleted) by contract or\nprogram specifications to meet specific program/project needs and constraints.\nThis standard is not intended to be self-imposing.  The criteria specified herein shall be the\nbaseline or preferred guidelines for NASA programs, but selection and tailoring to meet specific\nneeds are the responsibility of individual programs.  Existing programs and contracts may\ncontinue to use existing program or contract-unique GSE design requirements for the life of the\nprogram or contract (including follow-on contracts) on existing or new GSE for that program or\ncontract.  Retrofit of existing GSE to comply with this standard is at the discretion of the\napplicable program or project office.  When this standard is used in a procurement action, the\nstandard should be reviewed by the program/project office for applicability, and only the\nsections that apply to the project or program should be included in the procurement\ndocumentation.  The revision of this standard that was current at the time directions are issued\nto design, construct, manufacture, or procure the GSE shall be applicable for the useful life of\nthe GSE.  Modifications of existing GSE may be done so the modified GSE complies with the\nrevision that is current at the time directions are issued to modify the GSE.  This standard does\nnot apply to facilities.\nThe criteria of this standard may be used for the GSE used at the manufacturing, development, or\ntest sites prior to arrival at the launch, landing, or retrieval sites.  This standard is recommended\nfor the design of nonflight hardware and software used to support the operations of transporting,\nreceiving, handling, assembly, test, checkout, service, launch, and recovery of space vehicles and\npayloads at the launch, landing, or retrieval sites.
