I am making an AI and need a dataset. I have these two pages of different versions of a document.

VERSION A:
SCOPE
1.1
Purpose
The purpose of this standard is to establish the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) requirements for
any NASA system or component, flight or ground, where fracture control is a requirement.  This
standard defines the primary requirements for NDE in support of NASA-STD-5019, Fracture
Control Requirements for Spaceflight Hardware.  NDE applied in-process for purposes of process
control is not addressed in this document.
It is the policy of NASA to produce aerospace flight systems with a high degree of reliability and
safety.  This is accomplished through good design, manufacturing, test, and operational practices
including the judicious choice of materials, detailed analysis, appropriate factors of safety, rigorous
testing and control of hardware, and reliable inspection.  NASA fracture control requirements
stipulate that all aerospace flight systems be subjected to fracture control procedures to preclude
catastrophic failure.  Those procedures frequently rely on NDE to ensure that significant crack-like
flaws are not present in critical areas.
a.  NDE processes shall meet the requirements in this standard to screen hardware reliably
for the presence of crack-like flaws.
b.  Nothing in this document shall be construed as requiring duplication of effort dictated by
other contract provisions.
c.  Conversely, provisions stated herein shall not be interpreted to preclude compliance with
requirements invoked by other provisions.
1.2
Applicability
This standard is applicable to the fracture control of metal components, e.g. aluminum, steel,
titanium, and nickel alloys for any NASA system or component, flight or ground, where fracture
control is a requirement.
Conditional notes on applicability are presented in section 4.2.3.
a.  The requirements described herein shall apply to fracture-critical hardware developed
for NASA by NASA Centers, international partners, contractors, and outside organizations.

NASA-STD-5009
This standard may be cited in contract, program, and other Agency documents as a technical
requirement.  Mandatory requirements are indicated by the word “shall”; explanatory or
guidance text is indicated in italics.
b.  Tailoring for application to a specific program or project shall be formally
documented as part of program or project requirements and approved by the Technical
Authority.

VERSION B:
SCOPE
1.1
Purpose
The purpose of this NASA Technical Standard  is to establish  the nondestructive  evaluation
(NDE) requirements  for any NASA system or component,  flight  or ground,  where fracture
control  is a requirement.  This  NASA Technical  Standard defines the primary  requirements  for
NDE in support  of NASA-STD-5019A,  Fracture Control  Requirements  for Spaceflight
Hardware. NDE applied  in-process  for purposes of process control  and NDE of damage tolerant
composites  are not addressed in  this document.
It is the policy  of NASA to produce aerospace flight  systems with a high  degree of reliability  and
safety. This  is accomplished  through  good  design,  manufacturing,  test, and operational  practices,
including  the judicious  choice of materials,  detailed  analysis,  appropriate  factors of safety,
rigorous  testing and control  of hardware, and reliable  inspection.  NASA fracture control
requirements  stipulate  that all  human-rated aerospace flight  systems be subjected  to fracture
control  procedures to preclude  catastrophic failure. Those procedures frequently  rely on NDE to
ensure that the potential  failure  initiation  of relevant  crack-like flaws are not present in critical
areas.
Programs that are not human-rated  may choose to impose  these requirements  on a mission  or
hardware to bolster  the program or to serve as a stepping-stone  for human-rating.
1.2  Applicability
This NASA Technical  Standard is applicable  to the fracture control  of metal  components,  e.g.,
aluminum,  steel, titanium,  and nickel  alloys  for any NASA system or component,  flight  or
ground,  where fracture control  is a requirement.
Conditional  notes on applicability  are presented in section 4.2.3.
The requirements  described herein  apply  to fracture-critical  hardware developed  for NASA
applications  by NASA Field  Centers, international  partners, contractors, and outside
organizations.  NDE processes are required  to meet the requirements in this  NASA Technical
Standard to screen hardware reliably  for the presence of crack-like  flaws.
This NASA Technical  Standard is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers
and Facilities,  and applicable  technical  requirements  may be cited in contract, program,  and other
Agency documents.  It may also apply  to the Jet Propulsion  Laboratory (a Federally  Funded
Research and Development  Center (FFRDC)), other contractors, recipients  of grants and

cooperative  agreements, and parties to other agreements only  to the extent specified  or
referenced in applicable  contracts, grants,  or agreements.
Verifiable  requirement  statements are designated  by the acronym NER (Nondestructive  Evaluation
Requirement),  numbered  and indicated  by the word “shall”;  this NASA Technical  Standard contains
96 requirements.  Explanatory  or guidance  text is indicated  in  italics  beginning  in  section 4. To
facilitate  requirements  selection  and verification  by NASA programs and projects,  a Requirements
Compliance  Matrix  is provided  in Appendix  A.
1.3
Tailoring
Document tailoring  of the requirements  in  this NASA Technical  Standard for application  to a
specific program  or project  as part of program  or project requirements  and obtain  formal
approval  by the delegated Technical  Authority  in  accordance with NPR 7120.5,  NASA Space
Flight  Program and Project Management Requirements.
Technical  Authority  in this  context may vary from program to program. In accordance with
NPR 7120.10,  Technical  Standards for NASA Programs and Projects, section  2.2.4, “The NASA
Chief Engineer,  the Chief,  Safety and Mission  Assurance, and the Chief Health and Medical  Officer
serve as or may delegate Technical  Authority  for all  technical  standards within  their  areas of
responsibility.”

I want you to compare the two versions, then create a dataset entry in the format described below:

\### Instruction:
[Please put the page of version A here]

\### Output:
Suggesting Changes: [Yes / No, depending on if there are changes between the pages]
Current Language: [The language in version A that has been changed in version B]
Suggested Language: [The language in version B that replaced the language in version A]
Reason For Change: [The possible reason for the change between version A and B]

Please set "Suggested Changes" as "No" if the two pages are completely different and not related in any way.
