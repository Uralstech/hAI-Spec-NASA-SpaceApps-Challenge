I am making an AI and need a dataset. I have these two pages of different versions of a document.

VERSION A:
NDE REQUIREMENTS
The requirements set forth in this standard are the minimum NDE requirements for fracture-
critical hardware.  The application of Standard and Special NDE per the requirements of this
standard does not exempt fracture-critical hardware from routine NDE performed during
manufacturing.  The fracture control NDE procedures cited herein may exceed the requirements
for NDE procedures that are routinely performed for purposes such as configuration control and
process control.  NASA-STD-5019 provides the definition of fracture-critical hardware for all
spaceflight systems.
NASA-STD-5019 requires that all fracture-critical parts shall be subjected to NDE and/or proof
testing to screen for internal and external cracks.
4.1
NDE Procedures, Standards, and Methods
NDE procedures, standards, methods, and acceptance criteria shall be defined, validated,
documented, approved, implemented, and updated during all phases of life-cycle such as
manufacturing, operation, and maintenance of each fracture-critical part.
a.  All NDE inspections shall be conducted by certified NDE inspectors (see section
4.5.1).
b.  The fracture-critical NDE inspection procedure shall be clearly defined for each type
of part.
c.  Effective and reliable NDE methods shall be selected for all part or component life
cycles, including but not limited to manufacturing, maintenance, and operations.
d.  All identified part areas shall be inspectable.
4.1.1  Cracks
All detected cracks or crack-like flaws, regardless of size, shall be cause for rejection (see
section 4.4.2.1 and section 4.4.2.2).
4.1.2  Material Review Board (MRB)
The acceptance of cracks of any size in a fracture-critical part shall require an MRB action and
the approval of the responsible fracture control board (RFCB) and Technical Authority.

4.1.3  Detailed NDE Requirements
The NDE methods applied shall comply with the Standard NDE requirements of section 4.2 or
the Special NDE requirements of section 4.3.
4.1.4  NDE Drawing Callouts
NDE inspection requirements for all fracture-critical parts shall be clearly identified in all
drawings.
a.  The drawings shall clearly identify each inspection requirement by zone when
different zones require different NDE inspection requirements and acceptance criteria.
b.  The drawings shall be updated when NDE inspection requirements are updated.
4.1.5  NDE Process and Configuration Control
A written procedure for each fracture-critical part shall be developed that complies with the
relevant specification for the NDE method selected.
a.  Configuration control by revision or date shall be maintained current for the
following:
(1)  Personnel Qualification
(2)  Personnel Certification
(3)  NDE Specification
(4)  NDE Standards
(5)  NDE Part-Specific Procedures
b.  All NDE process changes require approval by the responsible NDE organization and
Technical Authority.
4.1.6  Capability Demonstration Specimens
a.  NDE capability demonstration specimens shall be used for determining the detection
capability for all Special NDE applications and may be used to validate the capabilities of
Standard NDE procedures.
b.  Specimens shall be representative of the material to be inspected and the critical
inspection area for the applicable hardware, and of the flaw size, type, location, and orientation.
The list of parameters may vary by NDE method.  Specimens may be borrowed from NASA or
other Government departments when available.
c.  If appropriate demonstration specimens are not available, specimens shall be built or
procured that meet both specimen requirements and fracture control requirements.

d.  Specimens used shall be documented as a part of the NDE procedures and personnel

4.1.7  Supporting Data and Record Retention
All certification records, NDE reports, and associated paperwork shall be retained per
NPR 7120.5, NASA Program and Project Management Processes and Requirements.
4.1.8  Organizational Guidelines and Documentation Requirement
It is recommended that a document be developed that meets the intent of the responsibilities and
authorities described in Appendix A.
4.2
Standard NDE
Standard NDE shall consist of formal nondestructive inspections of fracture-critical hardware
using the NDE methods cited in table 1 or 2.
The minimum detectable crack sizes shown in tables 1 and 2 are assumed in the damage
tolerance fracture analyses and are applicable only for metals.  The crack geometries for the
cracks in table 1 or 2 are shown in figure 1.
4.2.1  Standard NDE Methods
Standard NDE methods shall be limited to eddy current, fluorescent penetrant, magnetic particle,
radiography, and ultrasonics.
4.2.2  Standard NDE Crack Sizes
4.2.2.1   Nondestructive inspections of fracture-critical hardware shall detect the initial crack
sizes used in the damage tolerance fracture analyses with a capability of 90/95 (90 percent
probability of detection at a 95 percent confidence level).
The minimum detectable crack sizes for the Standard NDE methods shown in table 1 and 2 are
based principally on an NDE capability study that was conducted on flat, fatigue-cracked 2219-
T87 aluminum panels early in the Space Shuttle program, and meet the 90/95 capability
requirement.  Although many other similar capability studies and tests have been conducted
since, none have universal application, neither individually nor in combination.  Conducting an
ideal NDE capability demonstration where all of the variables are tested is obviously
unmanageable and impractical.
In order to make the broadest use of NDE flaw detectability data in table 1 or 2, good
engineering judgment needs to be applied.  For example, a flat panel is representative of a
component with a large diameter curvature.  It is also reasonable to use the table 1 or 2 data
values for most aerospace structural alloys such as titanium or stainless steel.

NASA-STD-5009
Regardless of the level of capability required of an inspection, the application of NDE
4.2.2.2
generally requires that the surfaces inspected be clean, smooth, and accessible.  The
component’s features, such as sharp radii, fillets, recesses, surface finish, cleanliness, material
selection, and other conditions can influence the capability of the applied Standard NDE
method;
a.  When this occurs, the method shall be evaluated to ensure that the Standard NDE
detection capability is not reduced (see section 4.2.3).
b.  The conditions and their evaluation shall be documented in the NDE Summary
Report.
4.2.3  Table 1 (or 2) —Minimum Detectable Flaw Sizes Conditional Notes
Since the table 1 (or 2) crack sizes were derived from a limited set of specimens of simple
geometry, applying the crack sizes to complex geometries, other materials, material forms,
material processes, and nonstandard NDE applications should be done with caution.
Where the real inspection conditions deviate significantly from the concept of flat fatigue-
cracked panel inspections, the transferability or similarity of the application of the table 1 or
table 2 crack sizes to real inspection situations should be evaluated and verified by documented
evidence, such as experimental data or other available test data documentation, for example, a
demonstration using penetrant, where capillary action is compared using penetrant on a curved
part and then a flat part.  Similarity can be established by other studies, data, or by supportable
rationale.  Similarity considerations should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823, Nondestructive
Evaluation System Reliability Assessment.
If similarity cannot be established, additional tests may be required including Standard or
Special NDE demonstration tests (see section 4.3).  The values listed in tables 1 and 2 may not
apply to thick-section components; threaded parts; weldments; compressively loaded structures;
double wall radiography; and other unique material, structural, or inspection applications.
4.2.4  Demonstration of Standard NDE Capability
a.  NDE procedure calibration on simulated or real crack-like flaws shall demonstrate
detection of the minimum detectable crack size.
b.  Implementation of Standard NDE methods in accordance with the following
requirements shall not require a formal demonstration of crack detection capability.
4.2.4.1   Eddy Current
Eddy-current inspections shall be in accordance with SAE-ARP-4402, Eddy Current Inspection
of Open Fastener Holes in Aluminum Aircraft Structure; SAE-AS-4787, Eddy Current
Inspection of Circular Holes in Nonferrous Metallic Aircraft Engine Hardware; or NASA
fracture control and NASA NDE Engineering-approved contractor internal specifications.

appropriate time in the manufacturing flow.
The final penetrant inspection can be performed prior to metal finishing operations such as
buffing or sanding that do not by themselves produce flaws.
4.2.4.2.2.1  Etching Procedure
a.  An etching procedure shall be developed, approved, and controlled to prevent part
damage.
b.  The etching procedure shall specify the minimum amount of material to be removed
to ensure that smeared metal does not mask cracks.
c.  If etching is not feasible:
(1) It shall be demonstrated, or
(2) Documented justification shall be provided that proves the required flaw size can
be reliably detected.
4.2.4.2.2.2  The etching process shall not exceed engineering drawing tolerances for part
dimensions and finishes.
When very close tolerances are required, critical surfaces should be machined near final
dimensions, etched and inspected, and finish machined.

Standard Practice for Ultrasonic Examination of Wrought Products, and NASA fracture control
and NASA NDE Engineering-approved contractor internal specifications.
4.2.5  Inability to Meet Standard NDE Inspection Process Requirements
If the requirements of section 4.2 cannot be met, or smaller cracks or crack-like flaws than those
shown in table 1 or table 2 have to be detected, then the inspection processes shall be considered
Special NDE; and the Special NDE requirements of section 4.3 apply.
4.2.6  Standard NDE Classification Justification
a.  The justification to classify an NDE procedure as a Standard NDE procedure shall be
documented and then approved by NDE engineering and Technical Authority.
b.  The justification shall be based upon evaluation of the NDE procedure as applied to

flaw detectability equal to or better than the Standard NDE minimum detectable crack size from
table 1 or table 2.
4.2.7  Standard NDE Deviations
All deviations from Standard NDE shall be approved by the responsible NDE engineering
organization, the RFCB, and Technical Authority.
4.3
Special NDE
4.3.1  General
Special NDE consists of nondestructive inspections that must be capable of detecting crack-like
flaws smaller than those detectable by Standard NDE (table 1 or table 2) or those that do not
conform to the requirements for Standard NDE given in section 4.2, Standard NDE.
Special NDE methods are not limited to fluorescent penetrant, radiography, ultrasonic, eddy
current, and magnetic particle methods.
4.3.2  Special NDE Crack Sizes
The Special NDE crack size can be any demonstrated size.
However, Special NDE inspections shall require the approval of the RFCB and Technical
Authority.
In those cases where the damage tolerance analysis requires smaller flaw sizes than those given
in table 1 or 2 for Standard NDE or the Standard NDE methods given in table 1 or 2 are not
applicable, then a Special NDE inspection is required.
4.3.3  Demonstration of Special NDE Capability
A 90/95 percent flaw detection capability shall be demonstrated before a Special NDE inspection
can be implemented.
The demonstration of the Special NDE inspection at a given crack size qualifies the Special NDE
for implementation for the detection of cracks at the demonstrated size and larger.
a.  The flaw detection capability of the Special NDE inspection method shall be
demonstrated by testing with flawed specimens.
b.  A sufficient number of flaws shall be included in the test demonstration to meet the
90/95 percent reliability requirement.
APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE—DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED

c.  The tests shall be designed on the basis of either the Point Estimate Method (section
4.3.5), the Probability of Detection Method (section 4.3.6), or other approved method.
d.  Special NDE Capability demonstration planning shall be approved by NDE
engineering.
4.3.4  NDE Capability Demonstration Specimens
The most accepted method of demonstrating Special NDE capability is with fatigue-cracked
specimens.  The preparation and control of demonstration specimens and how to administer
demonstration tests should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823.  In special cases, other flaws or
crack types that are more representative of the application may be used for the demonstration
with the approval of the RFCB and Technical Authority.
a.  Special NDE demonstration specimen selection shall be justified and approved based
on the similarity between the test hardware and the demonstration specimen.
b.  The justification shall be documented in the NDE summary report.
4.3.5  Point Estimate Method
The Point Estimate Method approach assumes that the capability of flaw detection increases with
the size of flaws in the neighborhood of the test flaw size.  Since only a small number of flaws are
required by this method, the minimum detectable flaw size may not be a determinant.
The above assumption shall be demonstrated or verified by documented evidence before the Point
Estimate Method can be implemented.
Qualification by this method demonstrates that the procedure and the individual operator are
capable of detecting flaws of the test size and larger.  Use of the Point Estimate Method should be
in accordance with the recommended practice found in Materials Evaluation, Vol. 40, No. 9, pp
922-932, 1982 (see section 5.1, Reference Documents).
4.3.6  POD Method
This method requires a large range of flaw sizes that span the initial crack size.  The large number
of flaws required by this method usually allows a minimum detectable flaw size to be determined.
Qualification by this method demonstrates that the procedure, either manual or automated, and
the individual operator are capable of detecting the minimum detectable flaw size and larger.  Use
of the POD method should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823.

NPR 1441.1,  NASA Records Management Program Requirements.
4.1.8  Organizational  Guidelines and Documentation Requirement
It is recommended that a document be developed that meets the intent of the responsibilities and
authorities described in Appendix B.
4.2
Standard  NDE
[NER 21] Standard NDE shall  consist of formal  nondestructive  inspections  of fracture-critical
hardware using  the NDE methods  cited in  Table 1, Minimum  Detectable Crack Sizes  for
Fracture Analysis  Based on Standard NDE Methods (inches),  or Table 2, Minimum  Detectable
Crack Sizes for Fracture Analysis  Based on Standard NDE Methods (millimeters).
The minimum  detectable crack sizes shown in Table 1 and Table 2 can be assumed as starting
points in the damage tolerance fracture analyses and are applicable only for metals. The crack
geometries for the cracks in Table 1 or Table 2 are shown in Figure 1, Assumed Flaw
Geometries.
4.2.1  Standard  NDE Methods
[NER 22] Standard NDE methods  shall  be limited  to eddy current, fluorescent penetrant,
magnetic  particle,  radiography,  and  ultrasound.
4.2.2  Standard  NDE Crack Sizes
[NER 23] Nondestructive  inspections  of fracture-critical  hardware shall  detect the
4.2.2.1
initial  crack sizes used in  the damage tolerance fracture analyses with a capability  of 90/95
(90 percent probability  of detection  at a 95 percent confidence level).
See section 4.2.7 for deviations from this requirement.
The minimum  detectable crack sizes for the Standard NDE methods shown in Table 1 and Table
2 are based principally on an NDE capability study that was conducted on flat, fatigue-cracked
2219-T87 aluminum panels early in the Space Shuttle program, and meet the 90/95 capability
requirement. Although many other similar capability studies and tests have been conducted
since, in our estimation, none have universal application, neither individually nor in
combination. Conducting an ideal NDE capability demonstration where all of the variables are
tested is obviously unmanageable and impractical.

NASA-STD-5009A
In order to make the broadest use of NDE flaw detectability data in Table 1 or Table 2, good
engineering judgment needs to be applied and should be supported by specific documented
analysis of the applicability or variance. For example, a flat panel is representative of a
component with a large diameter curvature. It is also reasonable to use the Table 1 or Table 2
data values for most aerospace structural alloys such as titanium or stainless steel.
Regardless of the level of capability required of an inspection, the application of NDE
4.2.2.2
generally requires that the surfaces to be inspected are clean, smooth, and accessible.
Component features such as sharp radii, tight fillets, recesses, poor surface finish, poor
cleanliness, non-traditional material selection, and other conditions can detrimentally influence
the capability of the applied Standard NDE method.
a.  [NER 24] If a non-ideal  inspection  condition  is encountered,  the NDE method  shall
be evaluated to ensure that the Standard NDE detection  capability  is not compromised  or
negatively  affected (see section 4.2.3).
b.  [NER 25] The inspection  condition  and evaluation  shall  be documented  in  the NDE
Summary  Report (section 4.4.2).
4.2.3  Table 1 (or Table 2) —Minimum Detectable Flaw Sizes Conditional Notes
Since the Table 1 or Table 2 crack sizes were derived from a limited set of specimens of simple
geometry, applying the crack sizes to complex geometries, other materials, material forms,
material processes, and nonstandard NDE applications should be done with caution. Where the
real inspection conditions deviate significantly from the concept of flat fatigue-cracked panel
inspections, the transferability or similarity of the application of the Table 1 or Table 2 crack
sizes to real inspection situations should be evaluated and verified by documented evidence, such
as experimental data or other available test data documentation; for example, a demonstration
using penetrant, where capillary action is compared using penetrant on a curved part and then a
flat part. Similarity can be established by other studies, data, or by supportable rationale.
Similarity considerations should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823, Nondestructive Evaluation
System Reliability Assessment.
If similarity cannot be established, additional tests may be required , including Standard or
Special NDE demonstration tests (see section 4.3). The values listed in Table 1 and Table 2 may
not apply to thick -section components; threaded parts; weldments; compressively loaded
structures; double wall radiography; and other unique material, structural, or inspection
applications.

a.  [NER 26] NDE procedure calibration  or instrument  standardization  on simulated  or
real crack-like  flaws shall  satisfy the demonstrated  detection  of the minimum  detectable crack

opportunities or minimum 45 flaws out of 46 flaw opportunities. A 90/95 minimum flaw size is

This method requires a large range of flaw sizes that span the targeted qualification flaw size.
The large number of flaws required by this method usually allows determination of a reliably
detectable flaw size a90/95. Qualification by this method demonstrates that the procedure and the
individual operator are capable of reliably detecting flaws larger than or equal to the
qualification flaw size. Use of the POD method should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823,
ASTM E3023, and ASTM E2862, as approved by the responsible NDE Engineering
Organization, with the added requirements of validation of the model output and the assumptions
behind each model.
[NER 84] In all POD approaches, the probability  of a false call and the single-sided  upper 95
percent bound  shall  be defined.
The false call rates for binomial analyses typically require no greater than 3.44 percent while a
