NASA-STD-5009A
Cracks or Crack-Like Flaws:  A discontinuity  assumed to behave like  a crack for
assessment of material  or structural integrity.
Defect:  One or more flaws whose aggregate size, shape, orientation,  location,  or
properties  do not meet specified  acceptance criteria and are rejectable.
Flaw:   An imperfection  or discontinuity  that may be detectable by  nondestructive
testing and is not necessarily rejectable. Examples of flaws in metallic  include  cracks, deep
scratches and  sharp  notches  that  behave  like  cracks,  material  inclusions,  forging  laps,
welding  incomplete  fusion,  penetration,  and  slag  or  porosity  with  a crack-like  tail.  For
additive  manufactured  metallics,  skipped  layers,  thermal  or  stress  induced  cracks,  or
inclusions,  as examples.
Fracture Control:   The rigorous  application  of those branches of design engineering,
quality  assurance, manufacturing,  and operations  dealing  with the analysis  and prevention
of crack propagation  leading  to catastrophic failure.
Fracture-Critical  Hardware, Component,  or Part:  Classification  that assumes that
cracks in  the hardware, component,  or  part could  lead  to a catastrophic  failure,  an event
that  results  in  loss  of  life,  serious  personal  injury,  loss  of  the  manned  flight  system,  or
national  asset.
Hardware Developer:   The organization,  NASA or prime  contractor, responsible
for the design,  development,  and manufacturing  of hardware that is subject  to fracture
control.
Initial  Crack (Flaw) Size:   The crack size that is assumed to exist  in the part for
damage tolerance analysis.
Instrument  Calibration:   Comparison  of an instrument  response with,  or
adjustment  of an instrument  response to, known  references often traceable to the National
Institute  of Standards and Technology  (NIST). This is usually  performed periodically,
typically  at a 1-year interval.  After completing  calibration,  a calibration  sticker with
calibration  expiration  date is affixed to the instrument.
Instrument  Standardization:   Adjustment  of an NDE instrument  response using  an
appropriate  reference standard with  known size discontinuities  such as electro-discharged
machined  slots and flat bottom  holes,  to obtain  or establish  a known  and reproducible
response. This is usually  done prior  to an examination  but can be carried out anytime
there is concern about the examination  or instrument  response. It is also commonly
known  as calibration  prior  to initiating  an NDE procedure.  Instrument  standardization
should  be carried out using  a minimum  of three data points  demonstrating  expected
correlation  between signal  response and discontinuity  size.

Material  Review Board (MRB):  After non-conforming  material  has been
identified,  this board reviews it and determines  whether or not the material  should  be
returned, reworked,  used as-is, or scrapped. Note:  The MRB consists of representatives
across many disciplines,  including  manufacturing  engineering,  materials  engineering,
Quality,  etc.
Minimum  Detectable Crack (Flaw) Size:   The size  of the smallest  statistically

assumed to exist in a part for the purpose of performing  a damage tolerance safe-life
analysis  of the part, component,  or assembly.
NDE Plan:  A plan  that describes the process for establishment,  implementation,
and control  of NDE of aerospace flight  hardware during  design,  manufacturing,  and its

perform a hardware-specific  inspection.
NDE Reference Standard:  A material  or object for which  all  relevant chemical
and physical  characteristics are known and measurable,  used as a comparison  for, or
standardization  of, equipment  or instruments  used for nondestructive  testing.
90/95  Probability  of Detection (POD 90/95):   Refers to 90 percent probability  of
flaw detection  with  95 percent lower confidence  bound.
Nondestructive  Evaluation  (NDE), Nondestructive  Inspection  (NDI),
Nondestructive  Testing  (NDT):  The development  and application  of technical  methods
to examine  materials  or components  in  ways that do not impair  future usefulness and
serviceability  in order to detect, locate, measure, and evaluate flaws; to assess integrity,
properties,  and composition;  and to measure geometrical  characteristics.
POD Qualification  (Qualified)  Flaw Size:   Qualification  flaw size is declared after
a  successful  completion  of  POD demonstration  test.  It  takes  into  account  the  reliably
detectable  flaw size,  material  conditions,  and flaw aspect ratios.  Qualification  flaw  sizes
may be used in fracture mechanics analysis. Minimum  detectable flaw size is the qualified
flaw size for Standard NDE.
Qualification:
The  skills,  training,  knowledge,  examinations,  experience,  and
visual  capability  required  for personnel  to properly  perform  to a particular  level.
Reference Document:   Written,  printed,  or electronic  matter that is useful  as
background  information  for the reader to help  in understanding  the subject matter but
does not constitute  technical  requirements  of the NASA Technical  Standard.

Reliably  Detected Flaw Size:   Reliably  detected flaw size is denoted  as a90/95 and
implies  that it can be detected with  90% POD with 95% confidence. The flaw size can be
